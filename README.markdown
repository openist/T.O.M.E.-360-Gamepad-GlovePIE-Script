Play T.O.M.E. the rougelike with a 360 Gamepad!

This is config for GlovePIE which has shifting functions, mode switches and all sorts of advanced stuff. I've got it working really good with special modes for inventory, feats, and look mode.

Never have to touch the mouse or keyboard if you don't want, supports up to 16 shortcuts. To use it you just need to download GlovePIE:

http://glovepie.org/

And grab my script from here:

https://raw.github.com/openist/T.O.M.E.-360-Gamepad-GlovePIE-Script/master/tome.PIE

When you open GlovePIE just use file -> open to open the tome.PIE file. Then click Run. You can then play TOME using a 360 pad no commercial software required! Check out the text file for the button mappings.

For those of you that don't know T.O.M.E. is a super excellent tactical combat focused rougelike with a awesome interface. Grab it here:
